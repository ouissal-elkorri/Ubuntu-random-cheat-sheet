# Ubuntu-random-cheat-sheet
In this repo I will add any command I needed while working on a project or just wanted to simplify life.


## Some random commands to simplify my access to the files/folders I have

### Access a pluged phone to USB port on my laptop

Android devices usually uses the **Media Transfer Protocol (MTP)** when connecting via the USB. This protocol works **differently** than the traditional USB.

```console
username@username-laptopname:~$ cd /run/user/1000/gvfs/
username@username-laptopname:/run/user/1000/gvfs$ ls
'mtp:host=OPPO_CPH1909_Z9UCWOFUFM69HYT4'
username@username-laptopname:/run/user/1000/gvfs$ cd mtp:host=OPPO_CPH1909_Z9UCWOFUFM69HYT4
username@username-laptopname:/run/user/1000/gvfs/mtp:host=OPPO_CPH1909_Z9UCWOFUFM69HYT4$ ls
'Internal shared storage'  'SD card'
username@username-laptopname:/run/user/1000/gvfs/mtp:host=OPPO_CPH1909_Z9UCWOFUFM69HYT4$
```


ouplaaa now you can go wherever you want

### Open a file 

```console
username@username-laptopname:~$ xdg-open fileName
``` 
If it's a PDF it will be opened with the **Document Viewer** 
If it's a normal file it will be opened with the **Text Editor**

## Git commands

### Delete a branch remotely after a local delete
If by any accident you wanted to delete a branch(remotely & locally) but instead of **-D \<branch-name\>** you wrote **-d \<branch-name\>**, it's okay you still don't have to complicate life and use the GUI. Follow me: 

The following line will save your life

```console
username@username-laptopname:YourProjectLocation$ git push origin --delete <remote-branch-name>
```

Bingooo, check your repo

### Get the changes from the preprod or master branch to your branch
I'm working on a project with a team, each one of us pushes the changes they do to branches named after their names, for me my branch is named **ouissal**, and when anyone finishes their work they merge it to a **preprod** branch. Now I want to get the changes **from the preprod to ouissal**, here is what I did

```console
username@username-laptopname:MyProjectLocation$ git checkout preprod 
username@username-laptopname:MyProjectLocation$ git pull
username@username-laptopname:MyProjectLocation$ git checkout ouissal 
username@username-laptopname:MyProjectLocation$ git rebase ouissal preprod
```

## MySQL cheat sheet 

**Access the MySQL command-line interface**
```console
username@username-laptopname:$ sudo mysql -u root
```

**Show DBs**
```console
mysql> SHOW DATABASES;
```
*Or*

```console
mysql> show databases;
```

**Describe the tables of the database**
```console
mysql> use database-name;
Reading table information for completion of table and column names
You can turn off this feature to get a quicker startup with -A

Database changed
mysql> show tables;
+--------------+
| Tables_in_BI |
+--------------+
| clients      |
+--------------+
1 row in set (0.00 sec)
```

**Verify the port number that the MySQL server is listening on**
```console
mysql> SHOW VARIABLES WHERE Variable_name = 'port';
+---------------+-------+
| Variable_name | Value |
+---------------+-------+
| port          | 3306  |
+---------------+-------+
1 row in set (0.10 sec)
```

**Know the users and the hosts**
```console
mysql> SELECT User, Host FROM mysql.user;
+------------------+-----------+
| User             | Host      |
+------------------+-----------+
| debian-sys-maint | localhost |
| mysql.infoschema | localhost |
| mysql.session    | localhost |
| mysql.sys        | localhost |
| root             | localhost |
+------------------+-----------+
5 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

**Know the password of your user**
1. In old versions of MySQL 
```console
mysql> SELECT Password FROM mysql.user WHERE User='root';
```
2. In MySQL 8.0 and later
```console
mysql> SELECT authentication_string FROM mysql.user WHERE User='root';
+-----------------------+
| authentication_string |
+-----------------------+
|    #your-password     |
+-----------------------+
1 row in set (0.02 sec)

```
